#' @param targetfilter the weights of the symmetric target filters (by default the Henderson filter).
#' @param accuracy.weight,smoothness.weight,timeliness.weight the weight used for the
#' optimisation. The weight associated to the residual is derived so that the sum of
#' the four weights are equal to 1.

#' @details
#' Moving average computed by a minimisation of a weighted mean of three criteria under polynomials constraints.
#' The criteria come from the decomposition of the mean squared error between th trend-cycle
#'
#' Let \eqn{\boldsymbol \theta=(\theta_{-p},\dots,\theta_{f})'} be a moving average where
#' \eqn{p} and \eqn{f} are two integers defined by the parameter `lags` and `leads`.
#' The three criteria are:
