\title{Estimation of a filter using the Fidelity-Smoothness-Timeliness criteria}
\usage{
fst_filter(
  lags = 6,
  leads = 0,
  pdegree = 2,
  smoothness.weight = 1,
  smoothness.degree = 3,
  timeliness.weight = 0,
  timeliness.passband = pi/6,
  timeliness.antiphase = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{lags}{Lags of the filter (should be positive).}

\item{leads}{Leads of the filter (should be positive or 0).}

\item{pdegree}{Local polynomials preservation: max degree.}

\item{smoothness.weight}{Weight for the smoothness criterion (in \eqn{[0, 1]}).}

\item{smoothness.degree}{Degree of the smoothness criterion (3 for Henderson).}

\item{timeliness.weight}{Weight for the Timeliness criterion (in \eqn{[0, 1[}). \code{sweight+tweight} should be in \eqn{[0,1]}.}

\item{timeliness.passband}{Passband for the timeliness criterion (in radians). The phase effect is computed in \eqn{[0, passband]}.}

\item{timeliness.antiphase}{boolean indicating if the timeliness should be computed analytically (\code{TRUE}) or numerically (\code{FALSE}).}
}
