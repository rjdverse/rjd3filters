\usage{
select_trend_filter(x, ...)

\method{select_trend_filter}{default}(x, ..., freq)

\method{select_trend_filter}{ts}(x, ..., length = 13)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{I/C ratio \code{\link[=ic_ratio]{ic_ratio()}} or a time series}

\item{...}{further arguments passed to or from other methods.}

\item{freq}{frequency of the time series used to compute the I/C ratio.}

\item{length}{length of the Henderson filter used to compute the I/C ratio.}
}
\description{
X-11 Selection of Trend Filter
}
\details{
The following procedure is used in X-11 to select the length of the trend filter:
\enumerate{
\item Computes the I/C ratio, \eqn{icr} with an Henderson filter of length 13.
\item The length depends on the value or \eqn{icr}:
\itemize{
\item if \eqn{icr < 1} then the selected length is 9 for monthly data and 5 otherwise;
\item if \eqn{1 \leq icr < 3.5} then the selected length is \eqn{freq + 1} where \eqn{freq} is the frequency of data (12 for monthly data, 4 for quarterly data...).
\item if \eqn{icr \geq 3.5} then the selected length is 23 for monthly data and 7 otherwise.
}
}
}
\examples{
# example code
x <- retailsa$AllOtherGenMerchandiseStores
sc <- henderson(x, length = 13, musgrave = FALSE)
icr <- ic_ratio(x, sc)
select_trend_filter(icr, freq = 12)
# Because Henderson filter is used, this is equivalent to:
select_trend_filter(x)
}
