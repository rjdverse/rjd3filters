\title{Impute Incomplete Finite Filters}
\usage{
impute_last_obs(x, n, nperiod = 1, backward = TRUE, forward = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{a \code{\link[=finite_filters]{finite_filters()}} object.}

\item{n}{integer specifying the number of imputed periods.
By default all the missing moving averages are imputed.}

\item{nperiod}{integer specifying how to imput missing date.
\code{nperiod = 1} means imputation using last filtered data (1 period backward),
\code{nperiod = 12} with monthly data means imputation using last year filtered data, etc.}

\item{backward, forward}{boolean indicating if the imputation should be done backward (on left filters), forward (on right filters).}
}
\description{
Impute Incomplete Finite Filters
}
\details{
When combining finite filters and a moving average, the first and/or the last points cannot be computed.

For example, using the M2X12 moving average, that is to say the symmetric moving average with coefficients
\deqn{
\theta = \frac{1}{24}B^{6} + \frac{1}{12}B^{5}+\dots+\frac{1}{12}B^{-5}+\frac{1}{24}B^{-6},
}
the first and last 6 points cannot be computed.

\code{impute_last_obs()} allows to impute the first/last points using the \code{nperiod} previous filtered data. With \code{nperiod = 1}, the last filtered data is used for the imputation, with \code{nperiod = 12} and monthly data, the last year filtered data is used for the imputation, etc.

\examples{
y <- window(retailsa$AllOtherGenMerchandiseStores, start = 2008)
M3 <- moving_average(rep(1/3, 3), lags = -1)
M3X3 <- M3 * M3
M2X12 <- (simple_ma(12, -6) + simple_ma(12, -5)) / 2
composite_ma <- M3X3 * M2X12
# The last 6 points cannot be computed
composite_ma
composite_ma * y
# they can be computed using the last filtered data
# e.g. to impute the first 3 missing months with last period:
impute_last_obs(composite_ma, n = 3, nperiod = 1) * y
# or using the filtered data of the same month in previous year
impute_last_obs(composite_ma, n = 6, nperiod = 12) * y
}
