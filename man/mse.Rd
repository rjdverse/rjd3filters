\title{Accuracy/smoothness/timeliness criteria through spectral decomposition}
\usage{
mse(aweights, sweights, density = c("uniform", "rw"), passband = pi/6, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{aweights}{\code{moving_average} object or weights of the asymmetric filter (from -n to m).}

\item{sweights}{\code{moving_average} object or weights of the symmetric filter (from 0 to n or -n to n).}

\item{density}{hypothesis on the spectral density: \code{"uniform"} (= white woise, the default) or  \code{"rw"} (= random walk).}

\item{passband}{passband threshold.}

\item{...}{other unused arguments.}
}

The criteria

\examples{
filter <- lp_filter(horizon = 6, kernel = "Henderson", endpoints = "LC")
sweights <- filter[, "q=6"]
aweights <- filter[, "q=0"]
mse(aweights, sweights)
# Or to compute directly the criteria on all asymmetric filters:
mse(filter)
