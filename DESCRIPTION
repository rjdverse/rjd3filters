Description: This package provides functions to build and apply symmetric
    and asymmetric moving averages (= linear filters) for trend-cycle
    extraction.  In particular, it implements several modern approaches
    for real-time estimates from the viewpoint of revisions and time delay
    in detecting turning points.  It includes the local polynomial
    approach of Proietti and Luati (2008), the Reproducing Kernel Hilbert
    Space (RKHS) of Dagum and Bianconcini (2008) and the
    Fidelity-Smoothness-Timeliness approach of Grun-Rehomme, Guggemos, and
    Ladiray (2018).  It is based on Java libraries developped in
    'JDemetra+' (<https://github.com/jdemetra>), time series analysis
    software.
