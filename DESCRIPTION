Description: This package provides functions to build and apply symmetric
  and asymmetric moving averages (= linear filters) for trend-cycle extraction.
  In particular, it implements several modern approaches for real-time estimates
  from the viewpoint of revisions and time delay in detecting turning points.
  It includes the local polynomial approach of Proietti and Luati (2008), the
  Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS) of Dagum and Bianconcini (2008) and
  the Fidelity-Smoothness-Timeliness approach of Grun-Rehomme, Guggemos, and Ladiray (2018).
  It is based on Java libraries developped in 'JDemetra+' (<https://github.com/jdemetra>), time series analysis software.
